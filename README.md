A neat tunnel into Penthouse, used to generate critical css.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

	*	Node.js

### Installing

A small step-by-step guide to setting up this project:

Install mode_modules:	`npm install`

Open up gulpfile.js, and enter the correct details of your target. An example of this can be found under the `/test` directory.


## Using

Enter a command prompt, and navigate to the root directory of this installation. Assuming you have configured the target inside `gulpfile.js`, you can proceed with the command `gulp`

You will be presented with a prompt to enter the URL of the target, and then asked where to output the final result. You shouldn't need to change these details, and can simply confirm the default values (set inside `gulpfile.js`) by hitting enter.
